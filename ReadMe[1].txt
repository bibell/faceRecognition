                 Face recognition system in GUI using tkinter module

 Before executing the finalregistor.py file you have to download all necessary module(libraries).than after once you run finalregistor.py file you will get graphical user interface that have five button,the first one is face detection demo once you click it, it will detect human face,the second one is register button when you press it you will get another window that required user name and password the reason behind these is only the administrator is allowed to register new student you can get the user name and the password in the finalregistor.py file. After you get the proper user name and password  you are allowed to login,once you login another window appear that allows administrator to register new student. Than the student information goes in to the database, the student face also goes in to face data base these information is used for train algorithm and of course for face recognition as well.

As I tried to explain once what ever button is pressed new window will pop up, I think that is a little bit wired, the entire thing can be done in one window,beside the face detection, face train and face recognition algorithm are within the some .py file and they are not embeded in to the tkinter gui.

These project is design to replace student ID card in to natural face and student natural face can be used for cafeteria use depend on the accuracy we get from ML algorithms,However the accuracy we  get is not more than 90% ,hence we use opencv rather than open face or deep face or other libraries that can leads to get more accuracy.
